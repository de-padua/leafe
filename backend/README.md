# Backend
===============

Description
-----------
This is the backend portion of the *leafe* project. It provides server‑side functionality such as routing, data management, business logic, etc. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the frontend component of *leafe*.

Contents
--------
- Routes and controllers: logic for handling HTTP requests and defining API endpoints  
- Models: definitions of data schema / entities  
- Services / utilities: helper modules for things like database access, validation, external integrations  
- Configuration: settings for environment variables, ports, database, etc.

Prerequisites
-------------
- Node.js (20+)  
- NPM or Yarn  
- A running database instance (e.g. PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc., depending on what is used)  
- Environment variables properly set (e.g. database URL, secret keys, etc.)

Setup
-----
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/toniswx/leafe.git
   cd leafe/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create or copy `.env` file, with required environment configurations. Ensure you have values for:
   - Database connection URL / credentials  
   - Port number  
   - Any secret keys or API credentials used  

4. Run migrations or set up the database schema if necessary.

5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   or for development with auto‑reloading:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

Usage
-----
- The API server listens on the configured port (default: e.g. 3000)  
- Endpoints follow REST for CRUD operations on the defined models  
- Error handling and status codes follow standard HTTP conventions
